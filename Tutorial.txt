Let's have the following in the basic first version of the app. 
====

Create a node js project. 
  npm i express graphql express-graphql

in server.js have the following code

// create a file server.js 
const express = require('express');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3001;

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: '', // Schema is not properly setup for this
  graphiql: true // graphiql is a client
}));

// GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries.

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log('GraphQL NodeJS App is running on http://localhost:3001/graphql');
});

// try node server.js and check the app at http://localhost:3001/graphql

//==================================================


// Advanced Tutorial
===============

They are two different ways of implementation. 
Using buildSchema uses the graphQL schema language while 
GraphQLSchema does not use the schema language, it creates the schema programmatically.
Our v1 project uses buildSchema.
This v2 project will use GraphQLSchema.


Let's create another project 
===
  npm i express graphql express-graphql

in server.js have the following code

// create a file server.js 
const express = require('express');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3001;

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: '', // Let's setup schema for graphql 
  graphiql: true // graphiql is a client
}));

// GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries.

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log('GraphQL NodeJS App is running on http://localhost:3001/graphql');
});

// try node server.js and check the app at http://localhost:3001/graphql

Step 1: 
---
  const GraphQLSchema  = graphql.GraphQLSchema;

  // Let's have the schema for the app
  // Schema is a combination of query and mutation
  const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
    //it expects query inside
    query:  .....,    // we have to create RootQuery for the app and associate it here
    mutation: .....   // we have to add mutation for the app and associate it here
  });

Step 2:
----
    we have to create RootQuery for the app and associate it in the schema 

    const RootQuery = '';
    //const Mutation = ''; // will implement  this later

  and associate the above in schema.
  
  const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
    //it expects query inside
    query:  RootQuery,    // do this now
    // mutation: Mutation   // will implement this later 
  });

Step 3:
----
  If we want to create root query we need to learn about datatypes for the root query data. 
  
  GraphQL has wide variety of datatypes such as GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString, GraphQLInt
  we can import them from 
    const graphql, { GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString, GraphQLInt } = require('graphql');

Step 4: 
---
  Let's properly build the root query. 
  RootQuery syntax will be like the following. 
  const RootQuery = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: ..., // you can decide on the name -- anything you want. it should be a string 
    fields: {
      ..., // getUserList
      ..., // getUserById
    }
  });

Step 5: 
---
  RootQuery is for the whole app. Inside it we can have feature wise queries. 
  It's like index page for all other pages. 
  So, Let's create a feature wise Query within the app. 
  Assume we are building user management app. Then, we will deal with users data. 
  For this we can create Query as UserType with the fields and their associated herewith. 

  const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'User',
    fields: () => ({
      id: { type: GraphQLInt },
      name: { type: GraphQLString },
      email: { type: GraphQLString },
      phone: { type: GraphQLString },
    })
  });

Step 6:
---
  In our RootQuery let's associate the above UserType Query 
  
  const RootQuery = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'RootQueryType',
    fields: {
      getUserList: { 
        type: new GraphQLList(UserType),
        args: { 
          id: {
            type: GraphQLInt
          }
        },
        // queries should have resolvers 
        resolve(parent, args) {
          // within this we can make db calls 
          // and return the data
        }
      }
    }
  });


Step 6: 
----
  const userData = require('./data.json');

  And in resolve function, do the following

  resolve(parent, args){
    return userData; // userData is the json object 
  }



Step 7:
====
  It's over. Query like the following from graphiql web interface 
 
  query{
    getUserList {
      id,
      name
    }
  }

====
With Querying is over ... Let's work on mutations. 
Create User, Update User, Delete User should be implemented

Step 8: 
------
